Estimate CO₂ emissions for Ligue 1 team travel by rail, road, and air. The project combines routing (Google Maps API), emission factors, and reproducible scripts to generate transparent calculations and shareable outputs.

## Repository structure

- **backend/services/**: Transport service classes for train, plane, and car calculations
- **backend/data/**: Input/output CSVs, including computed travel emissions
- **scripts/**: Entry points such as `retrieve_trajets` for end-to-end recomputation, and `calculate_emissions` to compute the final emissions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (uv recommended for environment management)
- Google Maps API key (`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `.env`)
- SNCF API key (`SNCF_API_KEY` in `.env`, used for train data)

## Getting a Google Maps API key
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com and create/select a project.
- Enable “Maps JavaScript API” and “Directions API”.
- Create credentials → API key, and restrict it to HTTP referrers or IPs as needed.
- Copy the key into your `.env` as `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
> ⚠️ Google occasionally updates the console UI and product names. If screens differ, follow the current Google Cloud instructions for generating a Maps/Directions API key.

## Getting an SNCF API key (for train data)
- Go to https://www.digital.sncf.com/startup/api and sign up/login.
- Subscribe to the “API SNCF” (Navitia) offering to generate an API token.
- From your dashboard, copy the token and keep it private.
- Add it to your `.env` as `SNCF_API_KEY`.
> ⚠️ SNCF’s portal and subscription flow may change. If steps differ, follow the latest instructions on the SNCF API portal for obtaining a Navitia token.

## Setup

1. Install uv (recommended):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   # Windows PowerShell:
   # powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
2. Create and populate `.env` at the repo root:
   ```
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   SNCF_API_KEY=your_sncf_api_key_here
   ```
3. Install dependencies and create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

- Recompute all routes and emissions (train, plane, car):
  ```bash
  uv run python -m scripts.retrieve_trajets
  ```
- Outputs are written to `backend/data/calculated_travels/`, including:
  - `train_emissions.csv`
  - `flight_emissions.csv`
  - `car_emissions.csv`
  - aggregated tables such as `total_emissions.csv`

- Compute the emissions table with:
  ```bash
  uv run python -m scripts.calculate_emissions
  ```
